# 01_Python_Introduction


## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

## Installation

Mac OS X and Linux comes pre installed with python. Windows users can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

To install IPython run,

    $ pip install ipython[all]
    
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook, qtconsole, tests etc.

### Installation from unofficial distributions

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome. Anaconda and Canopy comes pre packaged with all the necessary python libraries and also IPython.

#### Anaconda

Download Anaconda from https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages. Both python 2.7 and 3.4 options are available.

## Launching IPython Notebook

From the terminal

    ipython notebook

In Anaconda, Open the respective terminals and execute the above.

## How to learn from this resource?

You can download all the ipython notebooks from this repository https://github.com/milaan9/01_Python_Introduction and learn it on the notebook itself.

Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them

    Cell > All Output > Clear
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial?

You can star this tutorial. Starring is free for you, but it tells me
and other people that you like this tutorial.

Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/01_Python_Introduction) if you aren't here
already and click the "Star" button in the top right corner. You will be
asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection?

1. Go [here](https://github.com/milaan9/01_Python_Introduction) if you aren't
    here already.
2. Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of
    the page, then click "Download ZIP".

    ![Download ZIP](img/dnld_rep.png)

3. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more
    specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on
    which operating system you run.
4. Run `make-html.py` and follow the instructions.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the
repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage
with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole
tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to
pull with git and run `make-html.py` again.
