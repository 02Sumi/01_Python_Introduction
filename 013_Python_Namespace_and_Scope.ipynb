    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what names are, we can move on to the concept of namespaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, you can imagine a namespace as a mapping of every name you have defined to corresponding objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long as the interpreter runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason that built-in functions like **`id()`**, **`print()`** etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each module creates its own global namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "These different namespaces are isolated. Hence, the same name that may exist in different modules do not collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can have various functions and classes. A local namespace is created when a function is called, which has all the names defined in it. Similar, is the case with class. Following diagram may help to clarify this concept.\n",

    "Although there are various unique namespaces defined, we may not be able to access all of them from every part of the program. The concept of scope comes into play.\n",

    "A scope is the portion of a program from where a namespace can be accessed directly without any prefix.\n",

    "When we are in **`inner_function()`**, **`c`** is local to us, **`b`** is nonlocal and **`a`** is global. We can read as well as assign new values to **`c`** but can only read **`b`** and **`a`** from **`inner_function()`**.\n",
